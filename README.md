# âœ¨ Diwali Lights Showcase: Light Up the Grid! âœ¨

Welcome, Revamp GSoC Cohort! Get ready to illuminate our digital sky in this year's most dazzling Diwali celebration. We're building a massive, real-time grid of digital diyas, and each one will be lit by **you**.

As you light your diya, our shared screen will grow brighter. When your contribution is officially merged, fireworks will erupt in celebration! ðŸŽ†

## How to Add Your Light to the Celebration

Follow these simple steps to make your mark.

### Step 1: Craft Your Masterpiece ðŸŽ¨

This is where your creativity takes center stage! You're going to create a single HTML page that represents your personal Diwali celebration.

- **What can you create?** Anything! A beautiful animated greeting, a story of your favorite Diwali memory, a gallery of your celebration photos, or a simple, heartfelt message.
- **The only rule:** It must be a **single `.html` file**. Keep all your CSS and JavaScript inline within that file.
- **File Path:** Place your HTML file inside the `public/submissions/` directory. To keep things unique, use the format: `public/submissions/YOUR-GITHUB-USERNAME/YOUR-FILENAME.html`.

### Step 2: Submit Your Pull Request ðŸš€

Once your HTML masterpiece is ready, commit it and create a Pull Request to the main repository. This is your official entry into the showcase!

Our project maintainers will review it, and once it's merged, your diya will be ready to shine brightly for everyone.

### Step 3: Light Your Diya on the Grid! ðŸ”¥

Now it's time to make it official. Head over to the live application and follow these steps:

1.  Click the **"Light Your Diya"** button.
2.  Fill in your details in the form:
    - **Your Name:** So we know who to celebrate!
    - **Festive Message (Optional):** A short, sweet Diwali wish.
    - **HTML Path:** The *exact* path you used in Step 1 (e.g., `your-github-username/your-file.html`).
    - **GitHub PR URL:** The link to the Pull Request you created in Step 2.
3.  Hit **"Light It Up!"**

Your diya will instantly appear on the grid, glowing softly. Once your PR is merged, it will become fully clickable, and everyone will be able to see your amazing creation. Plus, did we mention **fireworks**? ðŸŽ‡

Let's make this the brightest Diwali ever. We can't wait to see what you create!

**Happy Diwali!** ðŸª”
